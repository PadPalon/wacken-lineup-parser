# Wacken Lineup Parser

Small tool to read the band names from the lineup of Wacken.

Let me know if you have a good idea how to figure out if a band is participating in the Metal Battle.

## Usage

1. Put the html of the lineup page (currently <https://www.wacken.com/de/programm/running-order-musik/>) into the `input.html` file
2. Run the `parser.py` script
3. All the bands can now be found in the `output` file
